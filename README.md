Pre-work cybersecurity. Username enumeration via different responses. Brute force attack with Burp proxy
1. The Mission
The owner of a blog has contracted your security firm to test their website for vulnerabilities.

Your mission is to hack into their blog. You suspect that you can find a user whose password is too simple. First, you need to find a registered user, and then you're going to attempt dozens of different common passwords.

This would be a tedious process, but luckily, you have Burp, and its trusty Intruder tool that's built for this very purpose.

2. Setup
Install Burp - Burp is used by cybersecurity professionals everywhere to view network traffic and test for security vulnerabilities.
Create a Portswigger account - Portswigger is the maker of Burp and has an Academy to hone your cybersecurity skills.
